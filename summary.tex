I consider my primary commitment to be in \keyword{thinking} and \keyword{solving problems} well. 
Put another way, as a task of grasping the {\it essence} of a given subject clearly, which involves a clear understanding of both the whole and the parts and the relations bringing them all together, like a beautiful painting.
% harmonious whole comprised of a delicate balance of various complex parts and relations, like a painting. 
% which requires understanding it comprehensibly as a harmonious whole comprised of a delicate balance of various complex parts and relations, like a beautiful painting. 
% The fun is in accomplishing the goal without crippling the balance.

% like a painter where the resulting image is made possible only by a delicate balance of the details, and no choice is arbitrary but has a clear reason in relation to the whole.
% Put another way, it is an art of grasping the {\it essence} of a given subject clearly, 
% which involves thinking not only logically but comprehensibly, 
% understanding the subject as a coherent whole comprised of often numerous complex parts, 
% and being able to visualize both the big picture and the deep underlying parts in relation to the whole.
% which involves understanding the subject comprehensibly as a harmonious whole of often numerous parts and complex relations, 
% and hence being able to visualize all levels from the big picture at the top down to the deep underlying details in relation to the whole. 
% harmonious whole comprised of often numerous complex parts and relations
% across all levels from the big picture and context at the top to the deep inner details.

% Thus, I value not only thinking logically and consistently, but more importantly, thinking comprehensibly, and constantly striving to retain in my mind a clear image of both the big picture and the deep details and their relations as a harmonious whole.
% Thus, I value not only thinking logically and consistently, but thinking comprehensibly, clearly holding in mind both the wide big picture including the problem context, and the deep underlying details and their relations.

% Consequently, I strive to not bind myself too strongly to specific labels, such as specific roles, technologies, and tools. 
As such, I do not feel attached too strongly to specific labels, such as specific roles, technologies, and tools. 
However, I derived much fulfillment from most recent 8 year experience as a {\it backend developer} and {\it architect}.
In particular, it was very fulfilling to work on {\it distributed systems} problems and {\it designing APIs, data structures, and protocols}, 
and I am keen on pursuing this path further as much as possible.
