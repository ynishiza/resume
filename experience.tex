      \item {\tgproject{Cognitive city (2019-2022)} a generic graph-model knowledge base, branded as a "social network of ideas".
        I was the principal designer and developer of the application backend.
        In addition to the core knowledge base, the backend supported various other services, 
        such as user management and authentication, API key, app customization, and data exploration and analysis tools.
        A distributed system written in Node.js backed by MongoDB, Neo4j and Elasticsearch, through which I studied and employed various principles such as 
        authentication+authorization, 
        data syncing+consistency, 
        data migration management,
        process parallelization+coordination, 
        fault tolerance, 
        access control, 
        process logging + monitoring, 
        etc.
        \tgsubitem test suite: one of my favorite accomplishments. Introduced rigorous test writing practice, thoroughly testing every change and feature, including security. 
        1800 tests at time of leaving. 
        Its robustness allowed us to constantly refactor and refine the code comfortably, and thus retain high code quality. 
        Also tried to share this success on the frontend which was seeking to be more robust, by designing and implementing a custom test framework in Cypress.
        \tgsubitem assisted with frontend and DevOps as necessary. 
        \tgskills (Backend) \rfnodejs, \rfmongodb, \rfneofj, \rfredis, \rfelastic, \rfbash, \rfdocker,

      \item {
        \tgproject{Exaptive Studio (2014-2019)} A low-code platform platform, featuring not only components client-side in JavaScript but also server-side in Python 2 and \rfrlang.
        I was the designer and developer for many of the core parts, including 
        the user-facing component interface and library package for all languages, 
        layout engine with a virtual DOM,
        component resource/dependency management and caching system, including JS dependency conflict handling (e.g use both D3 v6 and v7),
        and 
        server-side component execution system including an RPC and a multipart protocol over TCP/IP.
        \tgskills  \rfjavascript, \rfpython\ 2/3, \rfclang, \rfphp, \rfmysql, \rfredis, \rfdocker, TCP/IP, websockets, \rfhtml/\rfcss, \rfaws, \rfdthree

      \item{\tgproject{a WYSIWYG webpage editor} initially in C\#, then redesigned and implemented in TypeScript. 
      My main contribution was redesigning and implementing a more efficient layout engine, which converts the user design into corresponding HTML/CSS.
      Also assisted with frontend and DevOps as needed, such as writing shell scripts to deploy updates to AWS.
      \tgskills VMWare, Visual Studio, \rfcsharp, \rftypescript, \rfhtml/\rfcss, \rfmercurial, \rfbash, \rfaws
      }

      \item{\tgproject{Selective API, a reactive programming data structure with LINQ interface}
      this was before reactive programming became main stream, such as with React.
      My main task was designing and implementing a complete set of automated tests for the data structure, and fixing any issues found in the process, including performance issues. \\
      Also documented full specifications of the data structure, establishing logically precise definitions and verifying functional correctness.
