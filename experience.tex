      \item {\tgproject{Cognitive city (2019-2022)} a generic graph-model knowledge base, advertised as a "social network of ideas".
        I was the principal designer and developer for the application backend.
        Aside from the core knowledge base, the backend included various other services, 
        such as user management and login, API key, app customization, and analysis tools.
        The backend was a distributed system written in \rfnodejs, through which I learned various principals such as 
        authentication+authorization, 
        data consistency, 
        process parallelization+coordination, 
        fault tolerance, 
        access control, 
        process logging and site reliability, 
        etc.
        \tgsubitem test suite: introduced rigorous test writing practice, thoroughly testing every change and feature, including security. 
        Over 1800 tests at time of leaving.
        It was robust enough that we can constantly refactor and refine the code with ease. 
        \tgsubitem assisted with frontend and DevOps as necessary. 
        Designed and implemented test framework for the fronted team in \rfcypress.
        \tgskills (Backend) \rfnodejs, \rfmongodb, \rfneofj, \rfredis, \rfelastic, \rfbash, \rfdocker, 
        (DevOps) \rfaws, \rfansible, \rfterraform, \rfjenkins, \rfnewrelic, \rfsumologic,
        (Frontend) \rfreact, \rfcypress
      }

      \item {
        \tgproject{Exaptive Studio (2014-2019)} A low-code platform platform, featuring not only components client-side in \rfjavascript but also server-side in \rfpython 2 and \rfrlang.
        I was the designer and developer for many of the core components, including 
        the component interface and library package for users, 
        layout engine with a virtual DOM,
        component resource/dependency management and caching system,
        and 
        server-side component execution system including an RPC and a multipart protocol over TCP/IP.
        \tgskills (Primary) \rfjavascript, \rfpython 2/3, \rfclang, \rfmysql, \rfredis, \rfdocker, TCP/IP, websockets, \rfhtml/\rfcss, \rfaws

      \item{\tgproject{a WYSIWYG webpage editor} initially in \rfcsharp, then redesigned and reimplemented in \rftypescript. 
      \tgsubitem My main contribution was redesigning and implementing a more efficient layout engine, which converts the user design into corresponding \rfhtml/\rfcss.
      \tgsubitem Also assisted with frontend and DevOps as needed, such as writing \rfbash scripts to deploy updates to \rfaws.
      \tgskills VMWare, Visual Studio, \rfcsharp, \rftypescript, \rfhtml/\rfcss, \rfmercurial, \rfbash, \rfaws
      }

      \item{\tgproject{Selective API, a reactive programming data structure with LINQ interface}
      this was before reactive programming became main stream, such as with \rfreact.
      \tgsubitem My main task was designing and implementing a complete set of automated tests for the implementing structure, and fixing any issues found in the process, including performance issues. 
      \tgsubitem Also documented full specifications of the data structure, establishing logically precise definitions and verifying functional correctness.
      \tgskills VMWare, Visual Studio, \rfcsharp, \rflatex, \rfmercurial
