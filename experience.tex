Project: Cognitive City
Description: 

Primary designer and developer of application backend.
Backend: 
- a graph database with a multi-model backing:  \rfmongodb as core database, \rfneofj for graph queries, \rfelastic for text search
- interface: {\it REST API}
- Implementation: \rfnodejs 
- architecture: distributed


Features:
- safe data migration: 
A migration system with a migration history 
Advantage: 
  * retain record of migrations
  * can replay migration on any database
Disadvantage:
  * difficult to see the whole schema at any given moment, as changes are dispersed throughout the migration.
    Can workaround to some extent with schema validation.

- application architecture: 
Layers
* application interface layer: mainly handling HTTP requests
* application process layer: handling heavier processes
  e.g. writing data
  e.g. expensive reads, such as graph queries
* background layer: various background processes
  e.g. syncing multi-model database
  Separation of REST API layer from the main application process layer
concepts: message queue, worker processes


- parallelization and coordination: 
  Parallelized work for performance where possible 
  Write lock for data write coordination. Since REST API was separated and cloned, need write lock to safely coordinate writes. 
  tools: message queue


- data synchronization and consistency: 
  Data was synchronization of across the multi database models
  Synchronization was eventually consistent (weak consistency) i.e. Neo4j and Elasticsearch were eventually consistent.
  Monotonic aka order-preserving i.e. synchronization was performed in the order of writes
  concepts: message queue, worker processes


- error handling and error codes:

  
- fault tolerance: 
  Crash recovery 
  * safely restart process on crash
  * 

- access control
  Role based access control (RBAC) as basis
  Attribute based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained control 
   e.g. only element owner can read private element 
   e.g. only user with a given email domain (e.g. gmail.com) can read element


Testing:
Introduced rigorous testing practices to ensure that every feature and changes are tested thoroughly, including security tests (e.g. access control). 
1800 tests at time of leaving. 
Tests were robust enough that we felt comfortable refactoring any part of the code base and not fear losing and breaking a feature or introducing a bug in the process.
Implemented custom testing tools and frameworks to facilitate and thereby encourage testing
- an assertion library for asserting on HTTP requests easily
- a framework for declaratively defining access control tests based on user policy configuration.
- tool for easily managing common artifacts in a test setup
  e.g. each test needs a user
  A tool for creating a new user, setting user policies, logging the user in, etc.
  e.g. tests often need to interact with data in the knowledge graph
  A tool for creating new data in the knowledge graph, modifying, deleting, querying, etc


Site reliability:
- logging: defined logging practice 
  - definition of each log level
  - what should be in a message
  Implemented tool to support this practice.
- logging implemented structured logging to facilitate parsing logs
- logging: defined custom New Relic events for tracking uniform processes
  e.g. event to track the start and end/error of a worker process
- monitoring: setup monitors and alerts in New Relic
